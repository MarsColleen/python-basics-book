# Python Syntax

## Execute Python Syntax
As we learned in the previous page, Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:
```python
# adkajf;dskfas;dfj;sakjl
>>> print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!
```
Or by creating a `python` file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line:
```
C:\Users\Your Name>python myfile.py
```

## Python Indentation
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in **other** programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

### Example
```python
if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two!")
```
Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:
### Example
Syntax Error:
```python
if 5 > 2:
print("Five is greater than two!")
```

The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, but it has to be at least one.
